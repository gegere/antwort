## Responsive Email Templates

As I continue to build responsive email designs I am always looking to learn more and give back. Developers can be easily overwhemled with all the options available. In this repo you will find a complete collection of the top responsive email repos on **GitHub**. My goal is to bring several ideas together and offer a code base for developers as the importance of responsive email design continues to grow.

The goal of this project is to test code updates from the following repos and merge them into the final [templates](https://github.com/gegere/responsive-email-templates/tree/templates) branch.
